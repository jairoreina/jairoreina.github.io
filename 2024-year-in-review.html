        <h1>2024: A Year in Review</h1>
        <p>Jairo Reina | December 31, 2024</p>
        <h2>366 days</h2>
        <p>
            I've done a poor job at journaling and keeping track of things I've done this year outside of taking photos, so I'm relying on my admittedly poor memory and Google Photos to recount big events that happened in my life this year. On the surface, I feel like nothing much has changed. I'm still living on Long Island with my parents, I'm still working at the same company, and I'm still not a sub 3 hour marathoner (spoiler). However, if I think beyond just these basic characterizations, 2024 was a year of growth. I am certainly not the same person I was in January. For one, I'm much happier now than I was then. The image that I have of my life and the next five years got slightly clearer and at the same time I've learned to be more patient with myself. Anyway, lets get into a brief review of what happened this year, which thankfully is more positive than 2023.
        </p>

        <h3>January</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I ran 23 miles for my 23rd birthday. This felt great until mile 20 but the last three miles were some of the most mentally challenging 25 minutes of my life.</li>
            <li>Made a demo for a pretty cool project that was presented to the department head and the CEO of the company I work at. Received great feedback, but, unfortunately, the project never made it to production (gonna rewrite it for fun again soon, maybe).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>February</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Started training seriously for a half marathon and it felt really good to chase a goal again.</li>
            <li>Went on a trip to the Catskills with friends that solidified my belief that I need regular breaks from the city and suburbs. Being in nature and disconnected from everything is good for the mind.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>March</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hurt my calf and had to take a break from running. Recurring theme this year, which will hopefully not continue into 2025.</li>
            <li>Got the flu and thought I was dying for 2.5 days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>April</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not much happened, I guess. I extended my undefeated-at-Yankee-Stadium streak, saw Bad Bunny in concert, and I started running again after my calf healed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>May</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I ran a half marathon in 1 hour and 22 minutes. Not really much else to say except that I am incredibly proud of this performance.</li>
            <li>Made a two second cameo on TV in the crowd of an Austin Wells double to right field at Yankee Stadium (streak-extended).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>June</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Got close to two of my friends, Kim and Luis, while watching Copa America in Astoria (and Luis' place when we had to leave the bar because things got a lil hectic).</li>
            <li>My sister got engaged (Congratulations Ale and Oscar!), went to a Feid concert, then boarded a flight to Mexico all in the span of 12 hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>July</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>According to my camera roll, nothing much happened other than me watching Colombia play Copa America at Pig Beach in Astoria.</li>
            <li>Experienced heartbreak watching Colombia lose the final against Argentina.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>August and September</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I increased my mileage from 45 miles per week (mpw) to 60 mpw for the first time ever. Probably the fittest I've ever been aerobically. Unfortunately, 60 mpw was too much for me to handle at the time, and I hurt my calf again :(</li>
            <li>More Yankees games (streak-extended) and more concerts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>October</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I saw Nsqk, one of my favorite artists, in concert. Amazing show and you should all go listen to “BAD INTENCIONES” or “SIGO AL PENDIENTE”.</li>
            <li>I went to Chicago with my sister! It's my favorite American city behind New York. The ranking, from best to worst, currently stands at the following: NYC, Chicago, DC, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia.</li>
            <li>Experienced heartbreak once again as the Yankees fell apart in the World Series.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>November</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Got really into making dulce de leche and chocolate cake for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Started playing soccer with coworkers and biked to New Jersey and back to New York with Alexis. Hopefully these two activities continue into 2025.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>December</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Saw some high school homies at my friend Rochelle's birthday party.</li>
            <li>Started running again after a two month break. I signed up for an indoor mile race last minute and surprised myself running a 5:10 mile.</li>
            <li>Sat down to write my year in review.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Score</h2>
        <p>
            If I look back on my goals for 2024, I have to admit I barely checked any of them. I didn't run a marathon in under three hours. I started many books but never finished them. I didn't make public a single side project. If this is the case, then I have to ask myself, <em>what made 2024 a success?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In nominal terms, I may not have achieved those goals, but 2024 was a success for two main reasons: <strong>happiness and community.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Happiness</h3>
        <p>
            I've rewritten this opening more than 10 times because I'm trying to get it just right and it's hard to put into words. I attribute my happiness in 2024 to doing things that I love and want for myself and also not going through a ton of huge changes all in the span of a few months. You never know when your life is going to feel like it was turned upside down, so I'll focus on happiness stemming from doing things I love instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year I (maybe) ran the most I've ever run in a year. I spent more time with my parents and sisters. I committed to being consistent in making plans with friends and not just 'disappearing' for a few weeks. I also realized that alcohol really affects my mood and motivation the following day even if I don't drink much or wake up hungover. I stopped weighing myself or focusing on my weight and eat a lot better now. I've also come to terms with my personal religious beliefs and don't feel outside pressure to be more or less pious. There's probably many other small habits that I've subconsciously made or dropped that have helped me feel happier overall this year, but the point is that day by day I began to feel lighter.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's not to say this year has been perfect or easy. I spent more time than I would have liked visiting loved ones in hospitals. I still stress about work and relationships at times. I still put things off and wonder why I am stressed about my ever growing to do list (like scheduling a cardiologist appointment). But dealing with these things doesn't feel like the end of the world anymore. The best example of this I have is something that is slightly a joke and my friends/coworkers laugh at me for saying but its that “nothing ever happens” and “things have never not worked out”. I've visited family in hospitals a lot this year but everything always works out and there is never a doubt in my mind it won't. I genuinely believe this and it hasn't failed me yet.
        </p>

        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>
            In my <a href="things-i-learned-2023.html">“Things I Learned in 2023”</a> blog post, I wrote “My coworkers, family, and friends are all extremely supportive, and I can truly feel the excitement to learn and build new things” when talking about positive learning environments. It should go without saying that having people around you to support you makes for a better experience, but this year the importance of having a feeling of belonging, of community, really stuck with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important part of this feeling of community, though, is comfort and trust. I remember early on this year talking to a friend about at times feeling like I was walking on eggshells around people. I had to watch everything I said to make sure it didn't come off the wrong way or have it be told to a third party. That's not how things should be. I'm very glad I now feel surrounded by people who I can tell things to in confidence or not feel like I have pick and choose my words as to not start any gossip. If your friendship feels like a celebrity doing PR and finding exactly the right words to say, then something probably went wrong along the way.
        </p>

            If you're reading this and you're a homie, hey and thanks.
        </p>

        <h2>Other smaller lessons or thoughts.</h2>
        <p>I liked this section last year so I'll add a couple more to this year in review.</p>
        <h3>Don't skip leg day.</h3>
        <p>I hurt my calf twice from overuse this year while running and this could have easily been avoided by targeting my weaknesses (hamstrings and calves) while doing strength work. Don't skip it.</p>

        <h3>Know how to jumpstart a car.</h3>
        <p>I got stranded in a kinda shady spot once and had to have someone help me jumpstart the car. He was thankfully very helpful and much more knowledgeable than I was.</p>

        <h3>Challenge your own beliefs.</h3>
        <p>This year I focused on asking myself why I believe the things I do and be critical of where I get information from. Now, I don't want to get into a bunch of rationalist talk, but this really helped either change my beliefs or cemented what I already believed in.</p>

        <h2>Finally, goals for 2025.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Run a half marathon in under 80 minutes.</strong> Last year I wanted to run a marathon, but then I realized 26.2 miles is really long so I'll stick to the half for now. This might get amended to 79 or 78 minutes depending on how this spring's training block goes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Keep in touch with old friends.</strong> I had a friend from high school reach out to me a few weeks ago and it made me realize there's probably a couple people I should send a message to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Try more international cuisine.</strong> When it comes to international food, I am very uncultured. I have to take advantage of the fact that I live in New York and so close to Queens.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use my vacation days.</strong> I've got a lot of PTO days rolling over so I should probably use those on a nice vacation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Finish and ship side projects.</strong> Out of all the missed goals from last year this one probably bothered me the most. I really have to focus on this.
            </li>
